The wheelchairs available in market are too expensive and are beyond the reach of poor and middle class families. Most of the Wheelchairs are single functioned either it will be operated with voice or joystick. We are designing a wheelchair that will be a low cost and multifunction. This project aims to make life easier for the disabled and elderly people who cannot move properly it will enable them to lead better lives without any problem.
